This script extracts the contents of one or more zip or 7z archive files to a temporary directory, runs chdman on the cue file inside the extracted directory to create a chd file, and moves the chd file to the user's home directory. The needed dependencies are unzip, 7z, and chdman. Useful for converting zip or 7zip files with Playstation or Saturn bin/cue files inside to chd files that will work on several emulators (e.g. RetroArch). May work for other platforms as well.
